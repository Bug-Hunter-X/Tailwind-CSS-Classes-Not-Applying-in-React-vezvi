# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in React

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply in a React application, despite appearing correctly configured.  The problem, as detailed in `bug.js`, revolves around an incorrect usage of conditional rendering within the component's JSX structure.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, rectifies this by restructuring the conditional rendering to ensure Tailwind classes are correctly applied.  This example highlights the importance of carefully managing conditional rendering when working with Tailwind CSS.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the lack of Tailwind styles in the initial version (`bug.js`).
6. Examine the improved implementation in `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected approach.

## Problem and Solution

The core problem lies in improperly structured conditional JSX which can interfere with Tailwind's class parsing. The solution shows the correct way to apply classes while using conditional rendering.
