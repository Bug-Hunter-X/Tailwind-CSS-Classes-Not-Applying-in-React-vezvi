I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly in my React application.  The CSS was being loaded correctly, but the classes had no effect. I've checked my HTML structure and there are no obvious typos in class names. I am using the `@tailwind` directive correctly in my CSS file to include the generated styles. I've also ensured that Tailwind is properly configured within my `tailwind.config.js` file.
